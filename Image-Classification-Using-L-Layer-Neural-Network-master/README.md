# <prep>Image Classification Using L-Layer Neural Network<prep>

## Objective:
<p>In this project I will implement a L-Layer neural network for classifying an image as cat or not a cat. <p>
  
1. I will build a complete neural network architecture from scratch using 4 modules and test the performance of this neural network.
  
2. The 1st module is to initialize the parameters of the network

3. The 2nd module implements forward propogation in the neural network

4. The 3rd module implements backward propogation in the network

5. The third module updates the parameters using gradient descent

# Image-Classification-using-Layer-Neural-Network


## Image Classification using L-Layer Neural Network

This project implements an L-layer neural network for image classification, aiming to accurately categorize images into predefined classes.

## Repository Structure
	•	Image-Classification-Using-L-Layer-Neural-Network-master/
	•	Contains the main implementation files and datasets.
	•	README.md
	•	Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Model Architecture

The neural network is structured as follows:
	•	Input Layer: Accepts flattened image data.
	•	Hidden Layers: Multiple layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to capture complex patterns.
	•	Output Layer: Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/zainab-15/Image-Classification-using-Layer-Neural-Network.git
    cd Image-Classification-using-Layer-Neural-Network


    2.	Navigate to the project directory:

      cd Image-Classification-Using-L-Layer-Neural-Network-master


	3.	Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

     pip install numpy matplotlib


	4.	Run the Jupyter Notebook:

      jupyter notebook

Open the notebook file and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The model’s performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics. Graphs and visualizations are provided within the notebook to illustrate the training process and results. ￼
